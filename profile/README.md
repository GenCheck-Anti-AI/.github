🧠 GenCheck – Multi-Modal AI-Generated Content Detection Platform
GenCheck is a multi-modal content verification platform designed to detect whether a given text, image, or video is AI-generated or human-created. In an era of rapidly advancing generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, Midjourney, and deepfake generators, GenCheck brings transparency and trust back to digital content.

🚀 Project Goals
Build a reliable AI/ML-based detection system for text, images, and videos

Provide confidence scores and interpretable insights into content authenticity

Support popular formats with a seamless user experience for uploading and analyzing content

Use a modular architecture for easy extensibility (e.g., audio detection, metadata forensics)

Promote awareness of generative AI through explainable results and educational insights

🧩 Key Functionalities
🔠 Text Analysis Module
Detects AI-generated text (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, ChatGPT)

Outputs confidence scores and decision rationales (e.g., low burstiness, high predictability)

Supports plain text, PDF, and DOCX files

🖼️ Image Analysis Module
Identifies AI-generated images (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)

Highlights visual anomalies, forensic inconsistencies, and EXIF metadata absence

Detects known generation patterns or tampering artifacts

🎞️ Video Analysis Module
Detects deepfakes or AI-manipulated videos

Uses facial landmark tracking, blinking analysis, and lip-sync accuracy

Supports frame-by-frame anomaly detection

📊 Unified Report Dashboard
Clear detection result (Human / AI-generated)

Includes confidence scores, indicators, and analysis breakdowns

Maintains a history log of past analyses (user/session-based)

🔐 Optional Features
User Authentication – Save analysis history per account

API Access – Integrate GenCheck with third-party platforms

Exportable Reports – Download detection results in PDF format

💡 Target Users
Academic Institutions – Detect plagiarism or AI-written assignments

Media Companies – Verify the authenticity of images and footage

Recruiters & Hiring Platforms – Validate originality of submitted documents

Individuals – Anyone concerned about the credibility of content
